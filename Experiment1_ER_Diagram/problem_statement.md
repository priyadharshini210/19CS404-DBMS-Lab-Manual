# Experiment 1: Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

## 🎯 Objective:
To understand and apply the concepts of ER modeling by creating an ER diagram for a real-world application.

## 📚 Purpose:
The purpose of this workshop is to gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that visually represent the structure of a database including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

---

## 🧪 Choose One Scenario:

### 🔹 Scenario 1: University Database
Design a database to manage students, instructors, programs, courses, and student enrollments. Include prerequisites for courses.

**User Requirements:**
- Academic programs grouped under departments.
- Students have admission number, name, DOB, contact info.
- Instructors with staff number, contact info, etc.
- Courses have number, name, credits.
- Track course enrollments by students and enrollment date.
- Add support for prerequisites (some courses require others).

---

### 🔹 Scenario 2: Hospital Database
Design a database for patient management, appointments, medical records, and billing.

**User Requirements:**
- Patient details including contact and insurance.
- Doctors and their departments, contact info, specialization.
- Appointments with reason, time, patient-doctor link.
- Medical records with treatments, diagnosis, test results.
- Billing and payment details for each appointment.

---

## 📝 Tasks:
1. Identify entities, relationships, and attributes.
2. Draw the ER diagram using any tool (draw.io, dbdiagram.io, hand-drawn and scanned).
3. Include:
   - Cardinality & participation constraints
   - Prerequisites for University OR Billing for Hospital
4. Explain:
   - Why you chose the entities and relationships.
   - How you modeled prerequisites or billing.

# ER Diagram Submission - Priyadharshini.P (212223240128)

## Scenario Chosen: UNIVERSITY

## ER Diagram:
![ER Diagram](https://github.com/dharun06/files/blob/main/ERUNIVERSITY.jpeg)

## Entities and Attributes:
**University**

Attributes: uni_id, uni_name, location

**Department**

Attributes: dept_id, dept_name, uni_id (foreign key)

**Program**

Attributes: prog_id, prog_code, dept_id (foreign key)

**Student**

Attributes: reg_no, name, DOB

**Instructor**

Attributes: emp_id, name

**Course**

Attributes: course_code, course_name, credits

**Enrollment**

Attributes: enrol_id, reg_no, course_code
...

## Relationships and Constraints:
- **University - Department**
  - **Relationship**: `has`
  - **Cardinality**: 1:N (One university has many departments)
  - **Participation**: Total on Department

- **Department - Program**
  - **Relationship**: `Offers`
  - **Cardinality**: 1:N (One department offers many programs)
  - **Participation**: Total on Program

- **Program - Student**
  - **Relationship**: `contains`
  - **Cardinality**: 1:N (One program contains many students)
  - **Participation**: Total on Student

- **Student - Enrollment**
  - **Relationship**: `enrolls`
  - **Cardinality**: 1:N (One student can enroll in many courses)
  - **Participation**: Partial on Student

- **Enrollment - Course**
  - **Relationship**: `enrolled to`
  - **Cardinality**: M:1 (Many enrollments point to one course)

- **Course - Instructor**
  - **Relationship**: `taught by`
  - **Cardinality**: M:1 (Many courses may be taught by one instructor)
...

## Extension (Prerequisite / Billing):
- To represent **course prerequisites**, a **recursive relationship** is used on the **`Course`** entity. This models the situation where a course may depend on the completion of one or more other courses prior to enrollment.

- **Relationship Name**: `has_prerequisite`
- **Entity Involved**: **`Course`** (linked to itself)
- **Relationship Type**: **Recursive** – the same entity (**`Course`**) is involved twice, once as the dependent course and once as the prerequisite.
- **Cardinality**: **Many-to-Many (M:N)**
  - A course can have **multiple prerequisites**.
  - A course can be a **prerequisite** for **multiple other courses**.

This structure ensures that **academic requirements** are properly enforced and allows tracking of **dependencies between courses**.

## Design Choices:
- **Entity Identification**: Chose key real-world actors like `Student`, `Instructor`, `Course` because they reflect essential components in a university environment.

- **Relationship Logic**: Courses are taught by instructors and enrolled in by students, so those relationships model natural academic interactions.

- **Normalization and Keys**: Included foreign keys like `dept_id`, `prog_id`, `uni_id` for referential integrity and normalization.

- **Scalability**: The recursive relationship for prerequisites supports flexible course planning.

## RESULT
The ER diagram successfully models a real-world university scenario, capturing the hierarchy of departments and programs, course management, student enrollments, and instructor roles. The model is extendable with a recursive relationship for prerequisites, fulfilling all stated requirements.
